## 💡 Pro Tips

### Build Size Note
The 103 MB size is **normal and expected** because it includes:
- Complete Python runtime
- PyQt5 GUI framework
- matplotlib for charts
- pandas for CSV handling
- All other dependencies

It's a **fully standalone** executable - users need nothing else installed!

### Antivirus Warning
Some antivirus software may flag PyInstaller executables as suspicious (false positive). This is normal. Solutions:
- Add an exception for the .exe
- Build from source yourself to verify safety
- Consider code signing for production (optional)

### Future Updates
When you want to release v1.2:
1. Make your code changes
2. Update version number
3. Run `build_windows.bat`
4. Follow the Git commands again
5. Create new GitHub release
